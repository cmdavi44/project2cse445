HOTEL BOOKING MULTICELLBUFFER: https://github.com/crsiebler/HotelBookingSystem/blob/master/HotelBookingSystem/MultiCellBuffer.cs

- have to create 2 cruises (consumers)
- each cruise must have its own pricing model
- 40 >= ticket price <= 200

ticket agent needs to determine which price offered by a cruise is lowest, 
then create an orderclass and put it into the multibuffer.  The number of tickets to buy
is calculated by determining how many tickets a ticketagent has already purchased and the difference between the last price and the current.

orderobject will be sent to orderprocessing, this will ensure credit card info and total price based
on ticket price, number of tickets, tax, and location charge.  Once the credit card is deemed valid, 
the order object will be sent to the buffer.

- Cruise
    - Creates price, notifies event handlers in tickeagents when a price is lower than the previous
    - consumes order objects from the multicellbuffer

- ticketagent
    - Reads new lowest price, then determines whether or not to make a order for it and how many tickets,
    then sends the order object to the buffer

- orderobject
    - senderId: thread number
    - cardNo: integer of credit card
    - receiverID: cruise thread name or unique cruise name
    - quantity: number of tickets to order
    - unit price: double representation of unit price
